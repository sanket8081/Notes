#Hibernate - 01/03/2022#What is Hibernate?Hibernate is a framework for persisting or saving java objects into a database.But basically at very high level, you'll have your Java application, it'll make use of this Hibernate framework and you can use it for saving and retrieving data from the database.
#Benefits of Hibernate:1.Hibernate handles all of the low level SQL code.So it actually minimizes the amount of JDBC code you have to develop.
2.So Hibernate actually provides the Object-to-Relational Mapping(ORM).And it makes it really easy to create apps that store and retrieve objects from the database.So, as a developer you need to tell how Hibernate how your Java class or object how it maps to data in the database.//Saves the object:session.save(JavaObj);//retrives the objectsession.get(ClassName.class,primaryKey);//Querying for Java Objects:Query query = session.createQuery("from Student");List<Student> students =  query.list();#Relation between Hibernate and JDBC(Hibernate uses JDBC in the background for communicating with the database)1.Well, Hibernate actually uses JDBC for all database communications, so really,Hibernate is just another layer of extraction on top of JDBC.
2.So when your application uses the Hibernate framework, your app will store and retrieve objects using the Hibernate API.3.Hibernate does all of the low level JDBC work,and submitting the SQL queries and so on.
  So Hibernate does a lot of the low level work for you, but in the background it all goes through the standard JDBC API.
