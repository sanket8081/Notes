Unit testing in Spring Boot

What is Unit testing?
A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system.
In most programming languages,that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated part of the definition is important.
Tests are not unit tests when they rely on external systems: 
Example: “If it talks to the database, it talks across the network, it touches the file system, it requires system configuration, 
or it can't be run at the same time as any other test."


Dependency used/required:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	
By default added.
Libs which are included with this are: Junit,Hamcrest and Mockito.
Support for Assesrtion using assertJ lib is also provided. With all these support for xm and json binding is also provided.

JUnit:

JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. It plays a crucial role test-driven development, 
and is a family of unit testing frameworks.JUnit promotes the idea of "first testing then coding", 
which emphasizes on setting up the test data for a piece of code that can be tested first and then implemented. 
This approach is like "test a little, code a little, test a little, code a little." It increases the productivity of the programmer and the stability of program code, 
which in turn reduces the stress on the programmer and the time spent on debugging.

Hamcrest:

Hamcrest target is to make your tests easier to write and read. For this, it provides additional matcher classes which can be used in test for example written with JUnit.

Mocking:

Mocking is a way to test the functionality of a class in isolation. Mocking does not require a database connection or properties file read or file server read to test a functionality. 
Mock objects do the mocking of the real service. A mock object returns a dummy data corresponding to some dummy input passed to it.



Mockito:

Mockito facilitates creating mock objects seamlessly. It uses Java Reflection in order to create mock objects for a given interface. 
Mock objects are nothing but proxy for actual implementations.
Example: Consider a case of Stock Service which returns the price details of a stock. During development, the actual stock service cannot be used to get real-time data. 
So we need a dummy implementation of the stock service.

Benefits of Mockito
	No Handwriting − No need to write mock objects on your own.
	Refactoring Safe − Renaming interface method names or reordering parameters will not break the test code as Mocks are created at runtime.
	Return value support − Supports return values.
	Exception support − Supports exceptions.
	Order check support − Supports check on order of method calls.
	Annotation support − Supports creating mocks using annotation.
	

Testing your functions which are under Service and which are written in Repository can be tested individually i.e we can perform unit testing on them.
But if we want to test the controller it will come under integration testing as we will be combining more than 1 units.


Junit 5:

Guide to Junit 5:
https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests

@SpringBootTest

The @SpringBootTest annotation is useful when we need to bootstrap the entire container. 
The annotation works by creating the ApplicationContext that will be utilized in our tests.

Example:
@SpringBootTest(
  SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.MOCK,
  classes = Application.class)
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
@TestPropertySource(
  locations = "classpath:application-integrationtest.properties")

Here we're using WebEnvironment.MOCK here so that the container will operate in a mock servlet environment.
Next, the @TestPropertySource annotation helps configure the locations of properties files specific to our tests. 
Note that the property file loaded with @TestPropertySource will override the existing application.properties file.
The application-integrationtest.properties contains the details to configure the persistence storage:



@Test

@Test is used to signal that the annotated method is a test method. 
@Test methods must not be private or staticand must not return a value. 



@Disabled

@Disabled is used to signal that the annotated test class ortest method is currently disabled and should not be executed. 
@Disabled may optionally be declared with a reason to document why the annotated test class or test method is disabled. 
When applied at the class level, all test methods within that classare automatically disabled as well. 
When applied at the method level, the presence of this annotation does notprevent the test class from being instantiated. 
Rather, it prevents theexecution of the test method and method-level lifecycle callbacks such as @BeforeEach methods, 
@AfterEach methods, and correspondingextension APIs.


@AfterEach methods
The method which is annotated by this annotation is executed after every @Test method.

@BeforeEach methods
The method which is annotated by this annotation is executed before every @Test method.

@Order(int)
Is used to define the order of the test functions


@Mock
We can use @Mock to create and inject mocked instances without having to call Mockito.mock manually.
 
 Manual Way:
	List mockList = Mockito.mock(ArrayList.class);
    mockList.add("one");
    Mockito.verify(mockList).add("one");
    assertEquals(0, mockList.size());

 Using @Mock annotation
	@Mock
	List<String> mockedList;
	mockedList.add("one");
    Mockito.verify(mockedList).add("one");
    assertEquals(0, mockedList.size());

@ExtendWith
@ExtendWith is a repeatable annotation that is used to register extensions for the annotated test class or test method.
When @ExtendWith is present on a test class, test interface, ortest method or on a parameter in a test method or lifecycle method, 
the corresponding extensions will be registered in the order in which the @ExtendWith annotations are discovered. 
For example, if a test classis annotated with @ExtendWith(A.class) and then with @ExtendWith(B.class), extension A will be registered beforeextension B. 


###################################Test Driven Development using Spring##############################################

TDD - very popular in sw dev community because of the gains in software quality and shorter software release cycles.

# Reasons to why  we should practice TDD:

1)It is still true that design happens before development usually.
And you need to test your design before it's too settled because an
implemented bad design choice tends to be pretty expensive to change later in the development cycle.

2)Good test coverage is what I like to call executable documentation, 
which is the best documentation you can have on a software application.
When starting out writing automated test code for the first time, 
the low-hanging fruit test cases are the ones where you are verifying that all the acceptance criteria have been met for a feature

3)Automated tests, specifically unit tests are also very useful in helping to verify the parts before the whole.
Example: Consider that many teams are often developing different aspects of a feature simultaneously, does a great thing 
to be able to verify each part independently before it is integrated with other parts

4)Reading and running tests, especially for code you didn't write, will help you with understanding, and the better you understand it, 
the better position you'll be to start making safe changes

5)Training for a new developer. This allows the new developer to learn what the system actually does by taking advantage of executable 
documentation and contributing to it as well.


# Testing Spring Service Components

Usually TDD happens along with the Feature planning phase, to be specfic while writing user stories to begin planning feature development.
We are stating with service components as it is where so of the important business logic is implemented.
Before actually writing the test cases ask few questions to yourself first:
1) What features/components need test coverage the most? (As not all components/features are important)
2) What are the high priority test cases?
3) What tyype of test is needed? Unit or Integration or Both?


Test Plan:

The time defines which test do you need (Integration/Unit) depending upon in which sw development phase you are in.
Every component which is to be involved in integration test is already mature and settle, like they are perfect candidates for integration test.

# Integration Testing: 
This is an integration test, it involves exercising the interaction between the user management service, and the user management data access components.

Setup Preview for performing integration testing with Service components:
Intruct your Junit to do the folowing :

1) Not load @Controllers
2) Only load service and dependencies
	Example: @datarepository and similar
3) Connect to real data source (Test specific or other staging)


@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
We have to instruct JUnit that now we are testing a Spring application. So we do that by adding the @RunWith annotation.
As this annotation was replaced with @ExtendWith in Junit 5.But we can still use it for the sake of backward compatibility
Example: @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment =  WebEnvironment.NONE)
This let the JUnit environments bootstrap all of the required Spring components.
Now we want to Spring Boot to load only the required components which we require and ignore the rest.
We can implement this by adding the webEnvironment attribute and we will specify what kind of web environment we want to load during our test.

# Unit Testing 
1) We will writing user management unit test code with the purpose of just testing the user management service. 
	In particular, the addUser() method. Since we're isolating our testing to just the service component unit, 
	we are going to mock our data access component.
2) We do not care much about the actual behavior of a data access component, we will substitute a mock and we will be using Mockito to create a mock object.

Intruct Junit to do the following:

1) Not load @Controllers
2) Load mocks for @service and its dependencies
	Example: @date
3) Use Mockito for our mocking framework
4) There is no data source to configure
